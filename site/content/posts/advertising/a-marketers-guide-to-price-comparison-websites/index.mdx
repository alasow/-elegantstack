**SQL** waa luqad xogeed loo isticmaalo si xogaha loo keediyo (Structuring like tables) ,iyo sida xogta loo weydiiyo (Query) iyo sida xogaha la isugu xiro (Relationships) iyo sida xogaha layskugu xiro (Integration) iyo sida xogaha laysku dhaafsado (Transformation).

Waa luqud guud oo caalim ah taas oo ay soo saartay shirada lagu magacaabo IBM sanadkii 1970.Waxaa loo soo gaabiyaa (SQL) oo ah (Structured Query Language).Isticamaalka luqadaan waxaa ay kuru surra gelinee in daa abuurto,bedelo amara geliso xog meelo kawadan oo xogta lagu keeydiyo sida (MySQL,ORACLE,PostgreSQL,iyo waxii la helmaama).Guud ahaan waa luqad loogu talaglay si loogu xariiso databaseka

 **\    Waa maxay Database ?**  

Kahor intaanan si qoto dheer u galin casharkeena SQL, aynu fahano waxa Database(xogkeed) tahay.

Haddaba, xogtu waa shidaalka cusub ee adduunkan, laakiin xogtu waa xog aan habaysanayn, si aan xogtaas u habaynno, waxaanu samaynaa xog ururin. Xog-ururintu waa xog ururin habaysan, oo inta badan ay maamusho nidaamka maaraynta xogta (DBMS). Database-yada waxay naga caawiyaan si fudud u kaydinta, gelida, iyo habaynta xogta lagu hayo kombayutarka.

## SQL Tutorial

Our **SQL tutorial** helps you learn SQL (Structured Query Language) in simple and easy steps so that you can start your database programming quickly. It covers most of the important concepts related to SQL for a basic to advanced understanding of SQL and to get a feel of how SQL works.

SQL (Structured Query Language) is a programming language which is used to manage data stored in relational databases like MySQL, MS Access, SQL Server, Oracle, Sybase, Informix, Postgres etc.

**SQL** is a database computer language designed for the retrieval and management of data in a relational databases like MySQL, MS Access, SQL Server, Oracle, Sybase, Informix, Postgres etc. **SQL** stands for **Structured Query Language**. SQL was developed in the 1970s by IBM Computer Scientists.

> **SQL** is not a database management system, but it is a query language which is used to store and retrieve the data from a database or in simple words SQL is a language that communicates with databases.

## SQL Examples

Consider we have following CUSTOMERS table which stores customer's ID, Name, Age, Salary, City and Country −

| ID  | Name    | Age | Salary  | City       | Country |
| --- | ------- | --- | ------- | ---------- | ------- |
| 1   | Ramesh  | 32  | 2000.00 | Maryland   | USA     |
| 2   | Mukesh  | 40  | 5000.00 | New York   | USA     |
| 3   | Sumit   | 45  | 4500.00 | Muscat     | Oman    |
| 4   | Kaushik | 25  | 2500.00 | Kolkata    | India   |
| 5   | Hardik  | 29  | 3500.00 | Bhopal     | India   |
| 6   | Komal   | 38  | 3500.00 | Saharanpur | India   |
| 7   | Ayush   | 25  | 3500.00 | Delhi      | India   |

SQL makes it easy to manipulate this data using simple DML (Data Manipulation Language) Statements. For example, if we want to list down all the customers from USA then following will be the SQL query.

```

```

This will produce the following result:

| ID  | Name   | Age | Salary  | City     | Country |
| --- | ------ | --- | ------- | -------- | ------- |
| 1   | Ramesh | 32  | 2000.00 | Maryland | USA     |
| 2   | Mukesh | 40  | 5000.00 | New York | USA     |

## SQL Basic Commands

We have a list of standard SQL commands to interact with relational databases, These commands are CREATE, SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, DROP and TRUNCATE and can be classified into the following groups based on their nature −

### Data Definition Language (DDL)

A Data Definition Language (DDL) is a computer language which is used to create and modify the structure of database objects which include tables, views, schemas, and indexes etc.

| Command  | Description                                                                  | Demo                                                                                        |

## Why to Learn SQL?

SQL (Structured Query Language) is a MUST for the students and working professionals to become a great Software Engineer specially when they are working in Software Development Domain. SQL is the most common language used almost in every application software including banking, finance, education, security etc. to store and manipulate data.

SQL is fairly easy to learn, so if you are starting to learn any programming language then it is very much advised that you should also learn SQL and other Database related concepts to become a complete Software Programmer. There are many good reasons which makes SQL as the first choice of any programmer −

SQL is the standard language for any Relational Database System. All the Relational Data Base Management Systems (RDBMS) like MySQL, MS Access, Oracle, Sybase, Informix, Postgres and SQL Server use SQL as their standard database language.

Also, software industry is using different dialects of SQL, such as −

* MS SQL Server using T-SQL,
* Oracle using PL/SQL,
* MS Access version of SQL is called JET SQL (native format) etc.

## SQL Applications

SQL is one of the most widely used Query Language over the databases. SQL provides following functionality to the database programmers −

* Execute different database queries against a database.
* Define the data in a database and manipulate that data.
* Create data in a relational database management system.
* Access data from the relational database management system.
* Create and drop databases and tables.
* Create and maintain database users.
* Create view, stored procedure, functions in a database.
* Set permissions on tables, procedures and views.

## Who Should Learn SQL

This **SQL tutorial** will help both students as well as working professionals who want to develop applications based on some databases like banking systems, support systems, information systems, web websites, mobile apps or personal blogs etc. We recommend reading this tutorial, in the sequence listed in the left side menu.

Today, SQL is an essential language to learn for anyone involved in the software applicatipon development process including Software Developers, Software Designers, and Project Managers etc.
